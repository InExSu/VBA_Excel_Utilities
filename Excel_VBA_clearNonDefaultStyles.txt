' Non-default styles can propagate when there is a lot of copying between workbooks.
' Individually there isn't much of an impact to this, however over time a workbook can accumulate hundreds of styles
' This invariably leads to a slow down (and file size increase).

' The below removes all such non-default styles eliminating one cause of a slow workbook.

' For workbooks with a lot of style the below can take quite a while to finish and may appear to crash or hang.
' If you do experience 'hanging' closing the workbook and re-opening should fix the issue (with a part way style clearance completed).
